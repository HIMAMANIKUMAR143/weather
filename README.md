## About Me
I’m a web-focused developer who loves turning design ideas into accessible, responsive HTML experiences. I enjoy solving UI layout challenges, improving performance, and writing semantic markup that works across devices and assistive technologies.

- 🔭 Currently building: polished, accessible static pages and small web utilities
- 🌱 Always learning: modern HTML semantics, performance best-practices, and progressive enhancement
- 💬 Ask me about: semantic markup, responsive layout strategies, and building accessible UI
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy minimal, content-first design and measuring real impact with simple metrics

## What I Do
I focus on the front-end fundamentals that make sites fast, usable, and maintainable:

- Semantic HTML & accessibility-first markup
- Responsive layout (mobile-first CSS patterns)
- Performance best practices for static pages
- Converting designs into pixel-accurate HTML templates
- Small utilities and prototypes that solve a single problem well

## Tech & Tools
Here are the technologies and tools I commonly use:

- Markup: HTML5 (semantic elements, microdata)
- Styling: CSS (responsive design, modern layout techniques)
- Build / tooling: Static site setups, bundlers, and simple automation
- Testing: Accessibility checkers, responsive testing tools
- Other: Git, GitHub, VS Code

## How I Work
- I start by structuring semantic HTML and ensuring content-first accessibility.
- Then I layer responsive CSS and progressive enhancements.
- I verify performance (load time, bundle size) and accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader behavior).
- I ship small, iterative improvements and welcome feedback.
